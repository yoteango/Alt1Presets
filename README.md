# Alt1Presets
Basic Preset for Alt1. Works for slayer and afk Gathering. 

Nothing too advanced, just alerts I like. Uses chatbox and does not use the buff bar. Generally reliable. 
These are made for personal use. For your own use, please update the username in [Update]: Broadcast, along with any name changes accordingly. 

You may also wish to update or pause any values or sounds that you don't like. 

List of Alerts

* HP Alert
* Prayer Alert
* [UPDATE]: Broadcast - Looks for "News: Username" in Server, Global, and Clan Chat Colors
